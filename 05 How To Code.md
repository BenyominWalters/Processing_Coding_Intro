<h1 id="how-to-code">05 How To Code</h1>
<p>Before continuing, let’s learn about how to code.</p>
<p>As we already saw in the examples we tried so far, with code we send the computer commands. So far we only used simple commands that draw a shape or set a shape’s color. But we can do more!</p>
<h3 id="the-5-kinds-of-code">The 5 Kinds of Code</h3>
<p>To make more awesome projects like games, we need more commands. We will learn 5 kinds of code.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Stuff</strong> with <strong>Commands</strong><br>
This kind of code tells the computer to do stuff, like draw a shape or print words. (We already used some of these).</li>
<li><strong>Remember Stuff</strong> with <strong>Variables</strong><br>
For example, <strong>mouseX</strong> and <strong>mouseY</strong> where variables. We’ll start creating and using variables soon.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat Stuff</strong> with <strong>Loops</strong><br>
Sometimes we want to do something over and over. For example, the <strong>draw</strong> method we used in lesson 4 repeats over and over to make animation.</li>
<li><strong>Decide Stuff</strong> with <strong>Logic</strong><br>
To make a program interactive, we need to make decisions. For example, in a game you get points if you make a goal, and don’t get points if you miss.</li>
<li><strong>Organize Stuff</strong> with <strong>Methods</strong> and <strong>Classes</strong><br>
As our projects get bigger and better, we will want to keep our code well organized. This way it is easy to understand, and easy to find things we want to change. This part of the code isn’t for the computer, just to make things easier for us people writing the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we go through the next lessons we will learn new coding tools. Each tool will be one of these 5 kinds of code. And each tool will let us build bigger, better, and more fun projects!</p>
